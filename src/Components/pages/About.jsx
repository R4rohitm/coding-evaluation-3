        Wikipedia is an online free-content encyclopedia helping to create a
        world where everyone can freely share and access all available
        knowledge. It is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and consists of
        freely editable content. The name "Wikipedia" is a blending of the words
        wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the
        Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's
        articles provide links to guide readers to related pages with more
        information. Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous
        volunteers. Anyone with Internet access and in good standing can write
        and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where
        editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. Since its
        creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown into the world's
        largest reference website, attracting 1.7 billion unique-device visitors
        monthly as of November 2021. It currently has more than fifty-eight
        million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,489,446
        articles in English with 126,515 active contributors in the past month.
        The fundamental principles of Wikipedia are summarized in its five
        pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and
        guidelines, with which familiarity is not a requirement for
        contributing.
